Problem 1
---------

*Import, select, and tidy data*

``` r
NYC_Transit = 
  read_csv("./data_hw2/nyc_subway.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, 
         route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
NYC_Transit$entry = ifelse(NYC_Transit$entry == 'YES', TRUE,FALSE)
```

The `NYC_transit` dataset contains detailed information on station, routing, staffing, ada compliance, and vending. I used the janitor package to clean up the original data, and used the select function to choose the variables that will be focused on for this analysis. The dimension is 1868 rows by 19 columns. However, the data is NOT tidy yet because the route number (variables route1 to route11) is spread across 11 columns.
