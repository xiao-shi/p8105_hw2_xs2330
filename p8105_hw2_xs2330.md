Problem 1
---------

**Import, select, and tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = 
  read_csv("./data_hw2/nyc_subway.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
NYC_Transit$entry = ifelse(NYC_Transit$entry == 'YES', TRUE,FALSE)
```

The `NYC_transit` dataset contains detailed information on station, routing, staffing, ada compliance, and vending. I used the janitor package to clean up the original data, and used the select function to choose the variables that will be focused on for this analysis. The dimension is 1868 rows by 19 columns. However, the data is NOT tidy yet because the route number (variables route1 to route11) is spread across 11 columns.

**Distinct stations**

``` r
distin_line = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name")])
```

The resulting `distin_line` data

| line     | station\_name |
|:---------|:--------------|
| 4 Avenue | 25th St       |
| 4 Avenue | 36th St       |
| 4 Avenue | 45th St       |
| 4 Avenue | 53rd St       |
| 4 Avenue | 59th St       |
| 4 Avenue | 77th St       |

The amount of distinct stations is 465

**Ada-compliant data**

``` r
distin_ada_comp = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, ada) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(ada == "TRUE")
```

The resulting `distin_ada_comp` data

| line            | station\_name                  | ada  |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------|:-----|
| 4 Avenue        | Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       | TRUE |
| 4 Avenue        | DeKalb Av                      | TRUE |
| 4 Avenue        | Pacific St                     | TRUE |
| 42nd St Shuttle | Grand Central                  | TRUE |
| 6 Avenue        | 34th St                        | TRUE |
| 6 Avenue        | 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center | TRUE |

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant

**Proportion of station exits without vending that allow entrance**

``` r
distin_entry_novend = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, entry, vending) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(vending == "NO")
prop_entry_novend = mean(distin_entry_novend$entry == "TRUE")
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is 0.3873874

**Reformat to tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = gather(NYC_Transit, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
station_line_a = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name","route_name","ada")]) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A")
station_line_a_ada = filter(station_line_a, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serves the A train
There are 17 distinct stations that serves the A train that are also ADA compliant

Problem 2
---------

**Read and clean Mr.Trash Wheel data**

``` r
dumps = 
  read_excel("./data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel', range = cell_cols(1:14)) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit(dumps)
dumps$sports_balls = as.integer(dumps$sports_balls)
```

The resulting `dumps` data (column 1 through 6)

|  dumpster| month |  year| date       |  weight\_tons|  volume\_cubic\_yards|
|---------:|:------|-----:|:-----------|-------------:|---------------------:|
|         1| May   |  2014| 2014-05-16 |          4.31|                    18|
|         2| May   |  2014| 2014-05-16 |          2.74|                    13|
|         3| May   |  2014| 2014-05-16 |          3.45|                    15|
|         4| May   |  2014| 2014-05-17 |          3.10|                    15|
|         5| May   |  2014| 2014-05-17 |          4.06|                    18|
|         6| May   |  2014| 2014-05-20 |          2.71|                    13|

**Read and clean Precip data for year 2016 and 2017**

``` r
precip_2016 = read_excel("data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = '2016 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B14")
colnames(precip_2016) = c("month", "total_precip")
precip_2016$month = month.name
precip_2016 = na.omit(precip_2016)
precip_2016$year = 2016

precip_2017 = read_excel("data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",sheet = '2017 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B14")
colnames(precip_2017) = c("month", "total_precip")
precip_2017$month = month.name
precip_2017 = na.omit(precip_2017)
precip_2017$year = 2017
```

**Combine precip data for year 2016 and 2017**

``` r
precip_1617 = bind_rows(precip_2016, precip_2017) %>%
  select(year,month,total_precip)
```

The resulting `precip_1617` data

|  year| month    |  total\_precip|
|-----:|:---------|--------------:|
|  2016| January  |           3.23|
|  2016| February |           5.32|
|  2016| March    |           2.24|
|  2016| April    |           1.78|
|  2016| May      |           5.19|
|  2016| June     |           3.20|

**Summary of problem2 data**
The number of observations in the trash wheel data is 285 rows by 14 columns. The number of observations in the precipitation data is 24 rows by 3 columns. Key variables in the trash wheel data includes trash wheel index by `dumpster`, date of collection by `date`, weight of the specific trash wheel by `weight_tons`, and types of trash collected such as `plastic_bottles`, `chips_bag`, and `sports_balls`. Key variables in the precipitation data includes precipitation data such as `total_precip` and `year` for the year 2016 and 2017, by month. The total precipitation in 2017 was 32.93. The median number of sports balls in the dumpster in 2016 was 8.

Problem 3
---------

**load data from p8105 package**

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
```

**tidy and manipulate data**

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(str_detect(topic, "Overall Health") == TRUE) %>%
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, response, data_value) %>%
  spread(key = response, value = data_value) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(exc_vgood = excellent + very_good)
```

The resulting `brfss` data (showing column 1 through 6)

|  year| locationabbr | locationdesc                |  excellent|  fair|  good|
|-----:|:-------------|:----------------------------|----------:|-----:|-----:|
|  2002| AK           | AK - Anchorage Municipality |       27.9|   8.6|  23.8|
|  2002| AL           | AL - Jefferson County       |       18.5|  12.1|  32.7|
|  2002| AR           | AR - Pulaski County         |       24.1|  12.5|  29.9|
|  2002| AZ           | AZ - Maricopa County        |       21.6|  10.3|  26.9|
|  2002| AZ           | AZ - Pima County            |       26.6|   7.5|  31.9|
|  2002| CA           | CA - Los Angeles County     |       22.7|  14.3|  28.7|

**unique locations**

``` r
num_uniq_location = length(unique(brfss$locationdesc))
num_uniq_states = length(unique(brfss$locationabbr))
freq_state = plyr::count(brfss, "locationabbr")
highest_fre_state = freq_state[which.max(freq_state$freq),1]
```

The number of unique locations is 404. The number of states that's been represented is 51. Since all 50 states are included, we conclude that all states are represented. NJ is observed the most.

**Excellent response in 2002**

``` r
brfss_2002 = filter(brfss,year == 2002)
medi_2002_excellent = median(brfss_2002$excellent, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The median of the excellent response value is 23.6.

**Histogram of Excellent value in 2002**

``` r
ggplot(brfss_2002, aes(x = excellent)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Excellent response value in 2002")         
```

![](p8105_hw2_xs2330_files/figure-markdown_github/hist%20of%20excellent%20in%202002-1.png)

The histogram of Excellent value in 2002 shows the proportion of excellent scores in total health measurement in different locations accross the country in the year 2002. the x axis is the proportion of excellent scores, and the y axis is the count of locations with certain score.

**Histogram of Excellent score prop in NYC and Queens**

``` r
brfss_NYC_Queens = filter(brfss, locationdesc == "NY - New York County" | locationdesc =="NY - Queens County")
ggplot(brfss_NYC_Queens, aes(x = year, y = excellent)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = locationdesc)) +
  ggtitle("Excellent score proportion in NYC and Queens from 2002 to 2010") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

![](p8105_hw2_xs2330_files/figure-markdown_github/hist%20NYC%20and%20Queens-1.png)

The scatterplot of Excellent score prop in NYC and Queens shows the trend of excellent score proportion in these two areas from year 2002 to 2010. The x axis is year, and the y axis is the excellent score proportions. Red dots represent data in New York County, and green dots represent data in Queens County.
