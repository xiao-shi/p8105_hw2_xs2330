Problem 1
---------

**Import, select, and tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = 
  read_csv("./data_hw2/nyc_subway.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, 
         route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
NYC_Transit$entry = ifelse(NYC_Transit$entry == 'YES', TRUE,FALSE)
```

The `NYC_transit` dataset contains detailed information on station, routing, staffing, ada compliance, and vending. I used the janitor package to clean up the original data, and used the select function to choose the variables that will be focused on for this analysis. The dimension is 1868 rows by 19 columns. However, the data is NOT tidy yet because the route number (variables route1 to route11) is spread across 11 columns.

**Distinct stations**

``` r
distin_line = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name")])
```

The amount of distinct stations is 465

**Ada-compliant data**

``` r
distin_ada_comp = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, ada) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(ada == "TRUE")
```

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant

**Proportion of station exits without vending that allow entrance**

``` r
distin_entry_novend = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, entry, vending) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(vending == "NO")
prop_entry_novend = mean(distin_entry_novend$entry == "TRUE")
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is 0.3873874

**Reformat to tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = gather(NYC_Transit, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
station_line_a = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name","route_name","ada")]) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A")
station_line_a_ada = filter(station_line_a, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serves the A train
There are 17 distinct stations that serves the A train that are also ADA compliant

Problem 2
---------

**Read and clean Mr.Trash Wheel data**

``` r
dumps = 
  read_excel("./data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel', range = cell_cols(1:14)) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit(dumps)
dumps$sports_balls = as.integer(dumps$sports_balls)
```

**Read and clean Precip data for year 2016 and 2017**

``` r
precip_2016 = read_excel("data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet = '2016 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B14") %>%
  na.omit(precip_2016)
colnames(precip_2016) = c("month", "total_precip_16")
precip_2016$year_16 = 2016

precip_2017 = read_excel("data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet = '2017 Precipitation',
                         range = "A2:B14") %>%
  na.omit(precip_2017)
colnames(precip_2017) = c("month", "total_precip_17")
precip_2017$year_17 = 2017
```

**Combine precip data for year 2016 and 2017**

``` r
precip_1617 = left_join(precip_2016, precip_2017,by = "month")
precip_1617$month = month.name
```

**Summary of problem2 data**
The number of observations in the trash wheel data is 201 rows by 14 columns. The number of observations in the precipitation data is 12 rows by 5 columns. Key variables in the trash wheel data includes trash wheel index by `dumpster`, date of collection by `date`, weight of the specific trash wheel by `weight_tons`, and types of trash collected such as `plastic_bottles`, `chips_bag`, and `sports_balls`. Key variables in the precipitation data includes precipitation data such as `total_precip_16` and `total_precip_17` for the year 2016 and 2017, by month. The total precipitation in 2017 was 29.93. The median number of sports balls in the dumpster in 2016 was 13.
