Problem 1
---------

**Import, select, and tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = 
  read_csv("./data_hw2/nyc_subway.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, 
         route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)
NYC_Transit$entry = ifelse(NYC_Transit$entry == 'YES', TRUE,FALSE)
```

The `NYC_transit` dataset contains detailed information on station, routing, staffing, ada compliance, and vending. I used the janitor package to clean up the original data, and used the select function to choose the variables that will be focused on for this analysis. The dimension is 1868 rows by 19 columns. However, the data is NOT tidy yet because the route number (variables route1 to route11) is spread across 11 columns.

**Distinct stations**

``` r
distin_line = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name")])
```

The amount of distinct stations is 465

**Ada-compliant data**

``` r
distin_ada_comp = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, ada) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(ada == "TRUE")
```

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant

**Proportion of station exits without vending that allow entrance**

``` r
distin_entry_novend = select(NYC_Transit, line, station_name, entry, vending) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(vending == "NO")
prop_entry_novend = mean(distin_entry_novend$entry == "TRUE")
```

The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is 0.3873874

**Reformat to tidy data**

``` r
NYC_Transit = gather(NYC_Transit, key = "route_number", value = "route_name", route1:route11)
station_line_a = distinct(NYC_Transit[,c("line","station_name","route_name","ada")]) %>%
  filter(route_name == "A")
station_line_a_ada = filter(station_line_a, ada == TRUE)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serves the A train
There are 17 distinct stations that serves the A train that are also ADA compliant

Problem 2
---------

**Read and clean Mr.Trash Wheel data**

``` r
dumps = 
  read_excel("./data_hw2/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel', range = cell_cols(1:14)) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  na.omit(dumps)
dumps$sports_balls = as.integer(dumps$sports_balls)
```
